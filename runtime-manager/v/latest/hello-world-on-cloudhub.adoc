This Hello World tutorial helps you come up to speed quickly with CloudHub. It introduces the Runtime Manager, CloudHub and Anypoint Studio, the free development tool. You can see how easy it is to build your first project, create an Anypoint Platform organization, and then deploy your project to the cloud. Be sure to first take a look at link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] and link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] – a brief guide that introduces some of the basic CloudHub, Runtime Manager and Anypoint Studio concepts.

Completing this tutorial should take about 20 minutes. You can accomplish the following:

* Download and install Anypoint Studio
* Build a simple Hello World app
* Create an organization in the Anypoint Platform
* Upload, deploy, and run your project

== Downloading and Installing Anypoint Studio

Install the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/studio[latest version of Anypoint Studio].

Once the download is complete, follow the operating system-specific instructions shown on the download page to install Anypoint Studio.

== Creating a New Anypoint Studio Project

In the following steps, you build a simple Anypoint Studio project that creates a HTTP server within your project, and once deployed to CloudHub, echoes "Hello World" in a browser web page.

. The first time you start Anypoint Studio, you see a Welcome page. If this is the case, click *Create a Project*.
+If you already launched Anypoint Studio and closed the Welcome page, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
+

+
. The new project wizard opens.
. In the Project Name field, type `Basic Tutorial`. Click *Finish*.
+

+
[TIP]
You can explore additional setup screens by clicking *Next*, but for most Anypoint Studio projects, you can accept all defaults by clicking on the *Finish* button.
+
. After a few moments, the new Basic Tutorial project opens in the Package Explorer panel in Anypoint Studio. The flows node is open and an empty canvas is provided for building your first flow.
+
image:blank+canvas.png[blank+canvas]
+
[TIP]
This is the default Anypoint Studio configuration. It includes various panels, or views, that can be arranged, expanded, and minimized. The Package Explorer View is located to the left of the "canvas". The Palette is located to the right of the canvas, and includes categories for Connectors, Scopes, Components, and other elements. Initially only the Connectors and Scope categories are open; you can select category titles to view the various components within the Palette. Some categories, such as Transformers and Filters, have many components. They are accessible by using the scroll bars within their category.

== Building the Project

Follow these steps to build the Mule flow using the canvas and the Palette containing message processors:

. Locate the Connectors category in the Palette, scroll down or search for the *HTTP* connector, select it, and drag it onto the canvas. Since this is the first building block you are assembling on the canvas, you can place it anywhere by releasing your mouse while hovering over the canvas. The building block automatically positions itself to the left of the canvas as the first item in the flow.
+
[TIP]
You can also click once on the HTTP building block in the Palette, release your mouse, and then click once in the canvas to place the endpoint. This is an alternative placement method to drag-and-drop.
+

. Select the HTTP Connector in the flow.
. The properties editor appears.
+
image:fresh-http.png[http]

. Click the green plus sign next to the *Connector Configuration* field.

+
image:http1.png[http1]

+
The Global Element Properties dialog appears. A single Connector Configuration element can be referenced by multiple HTTP Connectors. You need to configure a few properties as described in the next step to have a working HTTP Connector.

. Fill in the required fields: *Host* and *Port*.
** Set the *Host* to `0.0.0.0.`
** In the General tab, change the value of *Port* to:  `${http.port}`

+
[width="100%",cols="30a,70a",options="header",]
|===
| Field | Value
|*Name* |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|*Host* |`0.0.0.0`
|*Port* |`${http.port`}
|===

+
Cloudhub uses the port placeholder `${http.port}` to dynamically allocate the application at deployment time.


. Click *Ok* to close this dialogue.

+
The Connector Configuration field now contains a reference to the element you just created. You can edit it further by clicking the `edit` icon.

. Accept the default value for the Path field: `/`
+
[width="100%",cols="30a,70a",options="header",]
|===
| Field | Value
|*Path* |/
|===
. Because you've included a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/configuring-properties[property placeholder] in the Port field, set the value of that property in the `mule-app.properties` file before continuing. In your Package Explorer, open the node *src/main/app*, and double-click the `mule-app.properties` file to open it. Once there, type `http.port=8081` and save the file.
+
. Open the Transformers category in the Palette (by clicking on the category header). Scroll down or search for *Set Payload*, and then drag this transformer onto the canvas. Release it just to the right of the HTTP Endpoint as shown below.
+
image:add+set+payload-1.png[add+set+payload-1]
+
When you release your mouse, Anypoint Studio positions the Set Payload transformer next to the HTTP Connector with a series of arrows. The arrows signify the direction of the "payload" messages within the flow.
. Select the new Set Payload transformer that you just placed on the canvas. In the Set Payload properties editor, enter `Hello World` in the *Value* field.

+

. Click the save icon to apply your changes.

You have now built a working Mule application! Although a simple application, this demonstrates with only two components how Anypoint Studio leverages a wealth of technology with simple drag-and-drop placement.

Next we create an Anypoint Platform organization for CloudHub, upload the project, and then deploy it.

== Creating an Anypoint Platform Organization for CloudHub

To deploy this application to CloudHub, you first need to create an organization in the Anypoint Platform. After you've created your account, you can use CloudHub for one month with a single resource unit, or "worker". If you need additional resources or would like to continue using CloudHub, you can sign up for a paid subscription.

. Go to link:http://anypoint.mulesoft.com[http://anypoint.mulesoft.com] to create an organization if you do not already have one. Otherwise, sign in using your credentials for your existing Anypoint Platform account.
. Enter your information, choose a username and password, and click *Create account*. Your new organization is created along with a user account. The resulting user account automatically becomes the administrator for the organization.

After you create your Anypoint Platform account, you are directed to the landing page. From the top menu, click the *Runtime Manager* link to go to the Runtime Manager dashboard.

== Deploying and Running Your Project

To deploy your application to CloudHub, return to Anypoint Studio, and follow these steps:

.. Right-click on the project node, `basic_tutorial` in Package Explorer, and then click *CloudHub* > *Deploy to Anypoint Platform > Cloud*.
+
image:deploy+to+cloudhub.png[deploy+to+cloudhub]
+
If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub.
+
[TIP]
You can manage these credentials through the Studio *Preferences* menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

. Sign in.
+
The Deploying Application page opens.
. Choose a unique domain in which to deploy the application, for example *helloworld*.
+
The domain name can be up to 42 characters. A green confirmation check mark displays.
. Select a *Mule Version* and environment, such as PRODUCTION, or accept the defaults.
. Change the Mule *Runtime* value to *3.7.0* or newer.
. Click *Deploy Application*.
+
image:studio+to+cloudhub2-1.png[studio+to+cloudhub2-1]
+
. Anypoint Studio packages, uploads, and deploys your application to CloudHub.
+
. Browse to the URL of *_yourdomain_.cloudhub.io* (also shown in the pop-up window above). You should see your application running on CloudHub! (Deployment may take a few minutes.)
+

+
[TIP]
Visit link:http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/[http://anypoint.mulesoft.com] to manage your application through the Runtime Manager, access its dashboard, view logs and alerts, and more.

You have now successfully created a new Anypoint Studio application and deployed it to your new Anypoint Platform account!
