= Deploying to Your Own Servers
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, deploy, manage, runtime manager, arm

Once you have link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[added a server (or server group/cluster)] to the Runtime Manager, you can deploy applications to it in the following ways:

// * *Anypoint Studio* - Right-click your project and click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*.


* *Anypoint Platform, link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud-based] version* - Go to the *Runtime Manager* section, and then from the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.
* *Anypoint Platform, On-Premise Edition* - Go to the *Runtime Manager* section, and then from the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.
* *Runtime Manager, On-Premise Edition* - From the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.

This page describes the options on the *Deploy Application* page, which is identical in all of the cases above.

[TIP]
====
Additionally, you can also deploy to your servers through:

* The *link:/runtime-manager/runtme-manager-api[Runtime Manager API]*
* Using the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/mule-maven-plugin[Mule-Maven Plugin]*
====


[NOTE]
To deploy an app to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloduHub]. Deploying to CloudHub is not possible via the link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/[Anypoint Platfrom On Premises Edition] or the link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/[Runtime Manager On Premises Edition].

== Accessing the Deploy Application Screen

=== From Anypoint Platform

To deploy an application:

. For the cloud-based version, log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] or click *Sign up* on the sign on page. Otherwise, open the application on your local server and log in.
. Click *Runtime Manager*:

. Click *Deploy application*:

+
[TIP]
*Note*: For more information on the *Servers* tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].
+
.  The Deploy Application page opens:

////
=== From Anypoint Studio

. With your application open in Anpoint Studio as a Mule Project, Right-click on the project node in the package explorer. Then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* > *Runtime Manager* from the cascading menu.
+

+
. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub.

+
[TIP]
You can manage these credentials through the Studio *Preferences* menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

. After you sign in, the Deploy Application menu opens.

== Creating an Application Name

Every application requires a unique application domain name. The application domain identifies your application in the Runtime Manager and also provides you with a public URL, `http://myapplicationdomain.cloudhub.io`, for accessing the application if it exposes any inbound endpoints.

In the *Deploy Application* dialog, enter a unique application name. The Application Name also becomes the `cloudhub.io` domain name that you use to access your application; for example the Application Name, `abcde` is accessible at `http://abcde.cloudhub.io`. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters. If the name is valid, the Runtime Manager alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

== Deployment Target

If you already have any servers registered to the Anypoint Platform, you will see a Deployment Target field that lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the CloudHub worker cloud
* On a server on premises, in a different cloud repo, a server group, or a cluster

This document focuses on deploying to CloudHub, for more information on deploying to servers, see

For more information on how to register a server, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers]



== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the *Choose file* button, select your application file, and then click *Open*. You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.) 

*Note*: The application file size limit is 100 MB.

=== Runtime Version

Since the server, server group or cluster you select implicitly has a single Runtime version installed in it, this is determined automatically by the server you select.

Keep in mind that servers in a cluster must have the same Runtime version installed in all of them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that the runtime version is the same Mule version used to develop your application. For example, if you use the default value prod-3.5.0 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log contains errors.
* To see what runtime version you set when you deployed your application, click the *Applications* tab and click your application. In the expansion view on the right, click *Manage Application*. Click *Settings* to see the deployment values.

== Configuring a Deployed Application

Most of the settings discussed in the steps above can be edited once the application is already deployed. To do so you must:

. In the Applications tab, select an application entry and click *Manage Application*:

+
. Click the *Settings* tab:

== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to red. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
