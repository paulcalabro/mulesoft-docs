The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering allows you to virtually create a private and isolated network in the cloud to host your integration work loads and to connect your VPC to your corporate intranet – whether on-premises or in other clouds – as if they were all part of a single, private network.

== How VPC Works

The Virtual Private Cloud creates a logically private and isolated network to host your CloudHub worker instances. +
It works as an extension of your own network and you can create safe connections between the VPC and the internal networks behind your firewall so you can extend your corporate intranet into the cloud (see image below).

You can leverage an *IPSec* gateway or *Amazon Web Services (AWS) _Direct Connect_* to connect the VPC to your corporate data centers or cloud infrastructure. +
Learn more about each connection alternative in the <<VPC Connectivity Methods>> section below.

== VPC Connectivity Methods

You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to a datacenter using any of these methods:

. *Public Internet:* Default connectivity to CloudHub VPC.

. *IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration:* Connect a network to a CloudHub VPC with link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec] as shown in the diagram below: +

[NOTE]
IPsec is, in general, the recommended solution for VPC to on-premise connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to connect, which integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers/appliances.

. *VPC Peering:* Pair an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC. +
If the services you are connecting to are hosted on AWS, then you can choose to peer your CloudHub VPC and your AWS VPC. +
Note that to leverage AWS Direct Connect you must be able to set up the direct connections within AWS.+
The diagram below illustrates connecting a CloudHub VPC and Amazon VPC together directly through VPC peering: +

== Configuring VPC for Your Account

The first step in setting up VPC for your account is to select the appropriate connectivity method for your use case. Then, contact your MuleSoft account representative to discuss your specific requirements. 

Once you have selected an option, download link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] (requires at least MS Excel 2007 with macros enabled), then enter data to communicate the necessary details required for your connectivity method. Once they receive your form and answer any remaining questions, the CloudHub support team securely exchanges keys and supplies instructions on how to configure your router(s).

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] has been completed and returned, though it may be completed sooner.

== Frequently Asked Questions about CloudHub VPC

*Can I reuse my existing Amazon VPC?*

No, but we can set up your CloudHub VPC to communicate with your existing Amazon VPC.

*How does VPC work with Amazon regions?*

Our VPC solution supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. If you need support for multiple regions, please submit one copy of the discovery form for each region in which you need support. 

*Can I have multiple VPCs?*

Yes, customers can purchase as many VPCs as required, with a minimum purchase of two.  For more information on VPC pricing, contact your MuleSoft Account Executive.

*Can I have multiple VPCs in a single Amazon region?*

Yes, this is possible, but not included in our standard setup. Contact your account representative to discuss your requirements.

*How do I limit communication with my workers to my VPC channel?*

If you have VPC and you don't want your application exposed via the publicly accessible load balancer at `myapp.cloudhub.io`, you need to use 8091 or 8092 instead of `${http.port}` or `${https.port}`, respectively, when deploying your application.

*How do I communicate with my workers through my VPC without going over the public Internet?*

You can communicate with your Mule worker by using mule-worker-internal-myapp.cloudhub.io as the address in your configuration. This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of all your workers.

*Can I assign an environment a VPC subnet?*

No. While VPCs can be shared across environments, you cannot control what subnet the environment deploys to.
