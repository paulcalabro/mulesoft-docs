By simply configuring a few settings on the Runtime Manager (both on the cloud-based and on the on-premise edition), the event notifications produced by your running Mule Applications can be easily sent out to your existing monitoring and analytics third party software.

[NOTE]
Sending data to third party software is a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to local servers. It is not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub]. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

You can currently send data out to any of the following:

* Splunk
* ELK (as an example for anything that consumes system Logs)

[INFO]
Future releases will also feature integrating with other third party systems.

The goal of this document to enable you to integrate Runtime Manager with a third party tool such as Splunk or ELK.

[TIP]
Wether you're using the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the on-premise edition of the Anypoint Platform, the features described in this page work identically in both. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.

== Basic Architecture

The Runtime Manager exists as:
* a component of the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-platform-primer[Anypoint Platform]
* a component of the Anypoint Platform on-premise Edition that you can install on-premises


On-premise versions of the Anypoint Platform have a Runtime Manager that handles only applications that are deployed on-premise or on your own cloud servers. The cloud-based version of the Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager that allows you manage applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/index[CloudHub] as well as applications that are deployed on-premises and to your own cloud servers. When using whichever version of the Runtime Manager, there's always a way to monitor your applications. Applications deployed to CloudHub can use link:/runtime-manager/link:/runtime-manager/insight[[Insight]: MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature. Applications that you deploy on-premises or to your own cloud servers can be integrated into third-party monitoring applications, which is what this document describes.

////
Applications deployed on Cloud can either use Insights (MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature) or be integrated into third party monitoring applications for a unified view of monitoring and analytics. Apps deployed on on-prem must be integrated into third party monitoring applications.
////

You have the ability to leverage both options to monitor business events, custom business events, logs, and – in the case of apps deployed to an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-gateway-101[API Gateway] Runtime – API Analytics and governance.

At a closer level of detail, the integration between Runtime Manager and third-party monitoring and analytics software looks like the diagram below:

image:amc_onprem_diagram_detail.jpg[image]

In between Runtime Manager and the external services is the link:/mule-agent/v/1.3.0/[Mule Agent], a module of Mule ESB that enables easy integration and sends event notifications to third party monitoring tools.

== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following software installed:

* Mule ESB – Version 3.6 or above
* API Gateway Standalone – Version 2.1.0 or above  (optional in case you want to deal with apps that are built with the API Gateway Runtime)

[NOTE]
Mule Agent 1.2.0 or above is required, the steps to install and configure it are provided below.

== Installation and Setup of Runtime Manager with a third party monitoring tool

In order to have Runtime Manager send data to an external monitoring tool, you must follow these steps, which are explained in detail further down.

image:steps-for-external-logs.png[steps]


=== Update the Mule Agent


First you must install the latest version of the Mule Agent, which is in charge of sending messages out of mule. In order to send event information to third party software, you need to have version *1.2.0* or newer of the Mule Agent.
See link:/mule-agent/v/1.3.0/installing-mule-agent[Installing the Mule Agent].

[NOTE]
====
Although the Mule Agent exists by default bundled with the Mule ESB download as of version 3.7, all ESB versions older than version 3.7.2 contain an old version of the Mule Agent that doesn't support this feature. If this is your case, you must download the latest version of the Mule Agent separately.

*Download it from http://mule-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/1.2.0/mule-agent-1.2.0.zip[here]*
====

=== Register the Mule Agent

Place the agent file in your `MULE HOME}/bin` folder, and then you must register it to the Runtime Manager by running a command in the terminal. Depending on wether you wish to use Runtime Manager on-prem or through the cloud platform, you must pass this command a different set of arguments to register it. To obtain the basic command that you must run (complete with your Runtime Manager instance ID) you must do the following:

To obtain this code, you must do the following:

. Sign in to your Anypoint Platform account
+
[TIP]
To open Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition, make sure you've already initiated Runtime Manager. If you haven't then you must boot it by running docker. Once initiated, you can access it by navigating to https://localhost in a browser.
. Navigate to `Runtime Manager - > Servers`
. Click `Add Server`. Without needing to actually add a new server, a sample command will be displayed in a popup window that includes the code for your particular organization. Copy this command, depending on where you wish to deploy, you may need to add extra arguments to it.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Anypoint Platform Cloud"]
....

When using Runtime Manager as part of the cloud-based Anypoint Platform, launch the agent with exactly the same command that you found on the Runtime Manager UI:

[source, linenums]
----
amc_setup -H 1c3eded9-7917-4a5e-bbe0-f73f9d4f33c1---2 myServer
----

or on Windows:

[source, linenums]
----
amc_setup.bat -H 1c3eded9-7917-4a5e-bbe0-f73f9d4f33c1---2 myServer
----

The argument `-H` is an id that references your organization in the Anypoint platform On-Premise Edition installation.

The final argument of this command is the name that you assign for your Mule Agent instance, in the above example, `myServer`. This name will then be visible when interacting with the agent from your Runtime Manager console.

....
[tab,title="Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition"]
....

When using the Anypoint Platform as an application running on-premises, launch the agent with the following arguments:

[source, linenums]
----
amc_setup -A http://localhost:8080/hybrid/api/v1 -W wss://localhost:8443/mule -C https://dev.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts -H 361755d7-c619-42ce-9187-19db7a6d94a0---2 myServer
----

or on Windows:

[source, linenums]
----
amc_setup.bat -A http://localhost:8080/hybrid/api/v1 -W wss://localhost:8443/mule -C https://dev.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts -H 361755d7-c619-42ce-9187-19db7a6d94a0---2 myServer
----

The argument `-H` is an id that references your organization in the Anypoint Platform installation.

The final argument of this command is the name that you assign for your Mule Agent instance, in the above example, `myServer`. This name will then be visible when interacting with the agent from your Runtime Manager console.

Note that three extra arguments must be added to what you copied from the Runtime Manager UI: -A, -W and -C.
* *A* sets the Runtime Manager host address
* *C* sets the Core Services host address
* *W* sets the Mule Communications Manager (MCM) host address

....
------

[TIP]
For more information on how to install or update the Mule Agent, see link:/mule-agent/v/1.3.0/installing-mule-agent[Installing the Mule Agent]

image:agent_server.jpg[image]

[NOTE]
Creating multiple agents within a single server is not supported.

==== Verifying Agent Registration

After running the above command, open Runtime Manager to verify that the agent has been registered successfully:

. Sign in to the Anypoint Platform with your credentials
. Go to `Runtime Manager - > Servers`. You should now see that one of those servers is your Agent instance, named with the name you provided when installing it:

image:verify_agent.jpg[image]

=== Configure Mule Custom Events

You can configure the Runtime Manager to send out Mule Events to external software, this includes flow executions, exceptions raised, etc. This works with apps deployed to any runtime, and for both the Runtime Manager in the cloud and the Runtime Manager that can be downloaded on-premises.

==== Integrating to Splunk

With link:http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk] you can capture and index Mule event notification data into a searchable repository from which you can then generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.

image:amc_onprem_diagram_detail_splunk.jpg[image]

===== Configuring your Splunk Account

In order to achieve this you must configure a new source type on your Splunk instance that will have the correct configuration to parse the HTTP Events sent from the Mule API Gateway.
To do this, you have to append the following source type to the $SPLUNK_HOME/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/props.conf
file.

....
[mule]
TRUNCATE = 0
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+)
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = JSON
KV_MODE = JSON
category = Mule Splunk Integration
description = Mule Agent event information
....

[NOTE]
If this file doesn't exist yet, you must create it.

After making these changes, you must restart your Splunk instance for them to take effect.

+
image:agent-to-splunk-tcp.png[splunk]
. In the Dropdown pick *TCP*, then provide the host and port for the connection

....
------

==== Integrating to an ELK Stack

ELK combines three open source tools (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) that work together to help you store, search and analyze log data. You can output the Mule event notifications as generic system logs, which can be handled by your ELK stack. Logstash captures and indexes the data into the log, from which you can then use Elastisearch and Kibana to generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.
The Agent helps you store all of the Event Notifications produced from the Mule ESB flows into a configurable log file with a rolling file policy.

image:amc_onprem_diagram_detail_elk.jpg[image]

To direct information to the folder where your ELK stack reads from, you must do the following:

. Select the server who's information you want to send out
. In the menu on the right, select *Agent Plugins*
+
image:log_menu.jpg[menu]
. Select the kind of information that you want to send out in the *Level* dropdown menu
+
image:track-type.jpg[track type]

. Activate the *ELK* switch, this will open a pop up menu where you can provide the address to the folder where you keep the log files that your ELK stack reads.
+
image:elk_config.jpg[ELK]
. Optionally, you can open the advanced menu and set up certain formatting properties of the data you send out and how the information is archived.
+
image:elk_config_advanced.jpg[ELK advanced]

=== Configure API Analytics

Before you can set up the connection to external software through the Runtime Manager UI, you must first make some changes to the API Gateway to prepare it for this.

. In your API Gateway Standalone directory, look for the `conf/wrapper.conf` file
. In it find the following line and make sure that the property is set to "true"
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_enabled=true
----

. Look for this other line:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
. Remove the URL in it, so that it looks like this:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=
----
. When using Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition, there's one more parameter you need to change:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.on_prem=true
----
+
`anypoint.platfrom.on_prem` is set to `false` by default. To manage it through the Anypoint Platform on-premise, you must set it to `true`. To manage it throguh the Runtime Manager in the cloud, leave it as `false`.

[TIP]
Note that in the above code snippets, when lines that contain `.<n>`, that should be replaced with an integer number that is unique within the wrapper.

Once you have set up your Stand Alone API Gateway, the steps for connecting to Splunk and ELK are identical to those when dealing with Mule Custom Events, except that you should set them up via the corresponding switches.

image:arm_api_analytics_settings.png[arm_analytics]

[WARNING]
If you modify your `wrapper.conf` file as described above but don't assign an external destination for your data (as you can do via the Runtime Manager UI), then this analytics data will be stored in a queue in the server where the API Gateway is being run and could pile up to the point of crashing the system.

== Integrating API Analytics to Splunk and ELK

Once you've configured your API Gateway, you can now return to Runtime Manager and see that your servers that run on API Gateway runtime have some additional options in their menu.

image:arm_api_analytics_settings.png[api analytics]

You can now set up the sending of API analytics to both Splunk and ELK, you configure exactly in the same way as you do when sending business events to them. See <<Integrating to an ELK Stack, Integrating to an ELK Stack>> and <<Integrating to Splunk, Integrating to Splunk>>.

== Encrypting Passwords

It's recommended that you assign a master password to your Mule ESB instance or your API Gateway Standalone instance when launching these. If you don't, then when setting up your credentials for external applications via the Runtime Manager UI, these will be stored as plain text in the `conf/mule-agent.yml` file. This is not recommendable for security reasons.

Instead, what you should do is launch Mule ESB or API Gateway with an extra argument that is then used to encrypt these passwords when storing them in this .yaml file.


[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Mule ESB"]
....

[source]
----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/mule -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

or on Windows:

[source]
----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\mule.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----


....
[tab,title="API Gateway Standalone"]
....

[source]
----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/gateway -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

or on windows:

[source]
----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\gateway.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

....
------

Note that, in order to have access to these encrypted passwords when you start Mule ESB and API Gateway again, you must assign the same master password you used when generating them.
In the case that you decide to change the master password or you omitted it when you launched the runtime, you have to reassign your passwords through the Runtime Manager UI to keep the third party integrations working.
