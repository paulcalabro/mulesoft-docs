Deploying an application is the first step to take on Runtime Manager, regardless of if you're targeting link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers].

[TIP]
If you deploy through Anypoint Studio, or use the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-cli[CloudHub command line interface] or the link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-api[Runtime Manager API], you do not need to go into the platform at all to have your application running.

After you deploy an application through the Runtime Manager, you can use the console to monitor and manage it at runtime. Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is a different set of possible actions you can perform on it, once deployed.

[TIP]
Wether you're using the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the on-premise edition of the Anypoint Platform, the features described in this page work identically in both. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.

This page introduces the basic management tools in the console that are common to both types of deployments:

* <<Start, Restart, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Status States>>
* <<Accessing a Running Application's Settings>>
* <<Updating your Application>>
* <<Downloading a Copy of Your Deployed Application>>



On applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers] you can additionally do the following:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers]
* link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending Data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Create clusters and server groups]

On applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[CloudHub] you can additionally manage the following elements:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/link:/runtime-manager/insight[[Insight]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[View application log data]
* link:/runtime-manager/worker-monitoring[Worker Monitoring]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-data-gateway[Secure Data Gateway]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]


== Getting Started

Sign in to the Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager*:

image:APStartScreen.png[APStartScreen]

The Runtime Manager has two main tabs, *Applications* and *Servers*.

=== Applications Tab

In the Runtime Manager, an application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule runtime or an API Gateway runtime instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, in an on-premise server of your organization, in a group of servers, or in a cluster.

In the *Applications* menu you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account. Click an entry to display additional information (as shown below), or click *Manage Application* to see the dashboard and the detailed page for the application:

image:AMC_ManageApplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

After you create at least one application, you can see your applications listed here, including the number of transactions and the percentage of CPU usage over the past hour.


[TIP]
For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group.

=== Servers Tab

In the Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule or API Gateway instance in a location other than CloudHub (on-premises or in a different cloud server) and that you must first register in the Runtime Manager console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you may deploy your applications to it through the Applications Tab.

image:AMC_Servers.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, by selecting an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* Add a Serve (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* Start Mule or API Gateway
* Create a Server Group
* Create a Cluster
* Add and remove Servers from a Server Group
* Add and remove Servers from a Cluster
* Stop an Application on a Server
* Delete a Server, Server Group or Cluster


For more on the options offered by this tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].



== Start, Restart, Stop, or Delete an Application

To start, restart, stop, or delete an application, click an application, and click the status down-arrow (the menus differ by Status):

image:AMC_RestartApp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]

Click *Start*, *Restart*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed. The *Start* command restarts stopped applications, *Restart* resets applications that have already started and if the application is Undeployed, sends the application's zip file to the server to start the application on the server.

[IMPORTANT]
For CloudHub applications, after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before being purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[Contact Support] for more information.


== Status States

The following states appear in the *Status* column:


.Application Status
[width="100a",cols="10a,90a",options="header"]

== Applications Dashboard

If you select any of the applications on the Applications tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you will be able to read additional information about the application and access its settings.

image:dashboard-ch.png[dashboard]

What this dashboard displays depends on if your application is deployed on link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[CloudHub] or on link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[a Mule server]. You will always see the status, the time of the last modification, and the deployed application .zip file, which you can change from this menu through the *Choose File* button. Applications on CloudHub additionally display info about the CloudHub worker they run on. Applications deployed on clusters and server groups additionally display the list of servers and the status of each.

CloudHub applications also present buttons that allow you to view Logs, Insights and enter the *Manage Application* menu.

== Monitoring Applications

Depending on if your application is deployed to CloudHub or your own servers, different tools exist for monitoring events that may occur on your application and the performance of the servers or virutal servers it's running on. See link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

== Accessing Settings for Apps on CloudHub

Sign in to the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] and view the *Applications* tab of the Runtime Manager. Select one of your CloudHub running applications to open a panel on the right side. On that pannel, click the *Manage Application* button to open up the application's settings.

image:cloudhub-manage-application.png[manage app]

In this menu you will be able to change most of the settings you can configure when deploying. For applications on CloudHub, you will also be able to access Log data, Insights, Alets, queues, set up and manage schedules and application data.

See link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[Managing CloudHub Applications] and link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[Managing Applications on Your Own Servers] for more details on each.



== Updating Your Application

If you made changes to your applications and would like to upload a new version, click *Choose file* on the Deployment screen for that application. The new filename appears in italicized text. Click *Apply changes* to use the new file for deployment. Within a few seconds, your application successfully redeploys. While redeploying, the application status indicator changes to blue, and then turns green after the deployment completes. For CloudHub applications, you can click *Logs* to see a live redeployment of your application.


== Downloading a Copy of Your Deployed Application

The application most recently deployed is always available for download from the console. Select the *Properties* tab on the application *Settings* page, then click *Choose file*. Specify a location on your computer to save the file.

image:DownloadAppFile.png[DownloadAppFile]

[NOTE]
====
*Link not available?*

If you can see the application name, but the name is not a live link, your administrator has disabled application downloads for users with developer and support account types. Contact your administrator if you need a copy of the application.
====
////
== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your application, such as deployment failures or application deletions. These alerts may be linked to a specific application or to all of them. See link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Alerts and Notifications] for instructions on how to do this.

All users of the Anypoint Platform, even those without permissions to create alerts, can then switch the alerts that are already created into an active or inactive state for their user. This determines what email alerts will reach their inbox.


[NOTE]
Switching an alert off from this view only switches it off for the user that is currently logged in, other users may still have it active.
