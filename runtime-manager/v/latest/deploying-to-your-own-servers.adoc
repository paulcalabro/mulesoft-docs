Once you have link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[added a server (or server group/cluster)] to the Runtime Manager, you can deploy applications to it in the following ways:

// * *Anypoint Studio* - Right-click your project and click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*.


* *Hybridly, via the Anypoint Platform, link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud-based] version*
* *Fully On-premises, via the Anypoint Platform On-Premise Edition*

// * *Runtime Manager, On-Premise Edition* - From the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.

This page describes the options on the *Deploy Application* page, which is identical in all of the cases above.

[TIP]
====
If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform on-Premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.

Additionally, you can also deploy to your servers through:

* The *link:/runtime-manager/runtme-manager-api[Runtime Manager API]*
* Using the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/mule-maven-plugin[Mule-Maven Plugin]*

[NOTE]
To deploy an app to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloduHub].

== Accessing the Deploy Application Screen

=== From Anypoint Platform

To deploy an application:

. For the cloud-based version, sign in to the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] or click *Sign up* on the sign on page. Otherwise, open the application on your local server and sign in.
. Click *Runtime Manager*:

[TIP]
*Note*: For more information on the *Servers* tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].
+
.  The Deploy Application page opens:

=== From Anypoint Studio

. With your application open in Anpoint Studio as a Mule Project, Right-click on the project node in the package explorer. Then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* > *Runtime Manager* from the cascading menu.

+
. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub.

+
[TIP]
You can manage these credentials through the Studio *Preferences* menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

. After you sign in, the Deploy Application menu opens.

== Creating an Application Name

Every application requires a unique application name. The application domain identifies your application in the Runtime Manager. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters. If the name is valid, the Runtime Manager alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

== Deployment Target

If you already have servers link:link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[registered to the Anypoint Platform], you will see a Deployment Target field that lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the CloudHub worker cloud
* On a server on-premises, in a different cloud repo, a server group, or a cluster

This document focuses on deploying to on-premise servers, for more information on deploying to CloudHub, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub]


== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the *Choose file* button, select your application file, and then click *Open*. You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.) 

*Note*: The application file size limit is 200 MB.

=== Runtime Version

Since the server, server group or cluster you select implicitly has a single Runtime version installed in it, this is determined automatically by the server you select.

Keep in mind that servers in a cluster must have the same Runtime version installed in all of them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the runtime version in the server or servers is the same Mule version used to develop your application. For example, if you deploy to a server that runs Mule Runtime 3.5.0 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log contains errors.
====


== Configuring a Deployed Application

You can change the application file of a deployed application

* Select your application in the *Applications* page to open its corresponding panel
* Click *Choose File* to upload a new file

[TIP]
Keep in mind that your application will then experience a moment of downtime while the new version you just selected is launched in the server, server group or cluster.


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to red. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
