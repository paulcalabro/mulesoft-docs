= Managing Applications On Your Own Servers
:keywords: cloudhub, managing, monitoring, deploy, runtime manager, arm

After you have link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[added a server] and link:link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[deployed an application] to it, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor and manage your application.

Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is a different set of possible actions you can perform on it, once deployed. This page focuses on the actions that are specific to applications deployed to your own servers, wether on the cloud or on premises. To view the basic management tools that are common to both types of deployment targets, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Managing Deployed Applications].

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers] you can do the following:

* link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending Data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Manage Servers]

[TIP]
Wether you're using the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the link:/anypoint-on-premises/[on premise edition] of the Anypoint Platform, or even the standalone link:/anypoint-on-premises/[on premise edition] of the Runtime Manager, features described in this page work identically in all of them.


== Applications Dashboard

If you select any of the applications on the Applications tab, a pannel opens on the right. Here you will be able to read additional information about the application and access its settings.

What this dashboard displays depends on if your application is deployed on link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[CloudHub] or on link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[a Mule server].

Aplications deployed to Mule servers show you the status, the time of the last modification, the deployed application .zip file – which you can change from this menu through the *Choose File* button – Applications deployed on clusters and server groups additionally display the list of servers and the status of each.

[TIP]
You can verify info about the servers the application runs on via the *Servers* tab. See more on link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#servers-dashboard[Servers Dashboard].
