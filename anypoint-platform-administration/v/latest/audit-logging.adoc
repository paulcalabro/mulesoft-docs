Changes made by users within an Anypoint Platform organization are logged through an audit logging service. You can access the data logs through the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/24562/versions/26089/pages/39846[Audit Logging Query API] or through the Audit Logging UI (currently in Public Beta).

== Overview

The audit logging service provides a queryable history of actions performed within the Anypoint platform, it keeps track of all users who have interacted with objects in the system, timestamping these actions and providing mechanisms for querying the set of users who have performed actions, the set of objects that have had actions performed on them, and other endpoints that enable the querying of log entries.

Each log entry has a set of properties that provides us with more information about the activity:

* *Time*: The timestamp when the activity occurred.
* *Product*: The product where the object resides. Example: "Access Management"
* *Type*: The type of the object on which the action is performed. Example: "Organization"
* *Action*: The Action associated with the object. Example: “Create”
* *Object*: The name of the Object. Example: “foo”
* *User*: The User who performed the action. Example: “johndoe”
* *Parent*: (Optional) The parent of the object (if any) on which the action is performed. Mainly relevant to APIs.
* *Payload*: (Optional) More information about the log properties. Example: If an Organization was created, then the payload would contain information about organization and the owner such as IDs.

== How to Access It

Users belonging to the *Organization Administration* role or the *Audit Log Viewer* role on the Anypoint Platform have access to both the UI and the Query API. The audit log service is business group aware, meaning, you will see only logs that are relevant to your own business group. The audit log UI is embedded in Access Manager, if you are not an Organization Administrator, but you have the Audit Log Viewer role, then you will see only the audit log UI under Access Manager.

To view the audit logs, click the gear icon on the top nav bar: image:gearicon.png[gear-icon]

== About the Content of the Log

Activities represented in the log are actions that occur at a particular time, involve one or more objects, have an action type (such as 'delete' or 'approve') associated with the objects, and optionally a payload which can store application-specific information such as changed fields, environment information, etc.

Below is a list of actions per Product and Object type that we currently audit in Anypoint platform :

=== APIs

==== Organization

==== API versions

==== Application

===== Portals

=== Access Management

==== Users

==== Roles

==== Permissions

=== Organization & Sub-orgs

=== Environments

=== Runtime Manager

==== Applications
